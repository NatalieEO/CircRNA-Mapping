# CircRNA-Mapping

We designed this workflow for a comprehensive circRNAs analysis using bwa and CIRI2. It could be used to call circular RNA candidates in paired reads fastq files and can be slightly modified fit single-end fastq files. To ensure reproducibility, each function used in the pipeline was embeded into a public docker image.

This workflow is also public in Dockerstore and can be readily used in Terra and many other computational platform.
